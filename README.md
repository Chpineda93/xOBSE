This is the continuation of the original Oblivion Script Extender, an injectors that extend the functionality of The Elder Scroll 4 Oblivion, that still has some outstanding bugs in its code.

Inspired by the recent work on xNVSE, I rekindled my interest in this project.

My previous attempt at this (in the branch obsev22 now stale) was a bit of a mess, including some possible retrocompatibility changes with mods, and also some users reported crashes.
This attempt is to be more conservative in the changes, avoid functionality changes when preferable.

The original repo also has sometimes confusionary commit messages, and I want to do more trackable and self-isolated commits.

OBSE is a project of Ian Patterson (ianpatt), Stephen Abel (behippo), Paul Connelly (scruggsywuggsy the ferret) with the outstanding contributions of Timeslip, The J, DragoonWraith, SkyRanger-1, shademe, kyoma

May Shadows Hide You.
